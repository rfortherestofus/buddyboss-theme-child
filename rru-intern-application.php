                    <p>Hi, I’m David and I run R for the Rest of Us. I’m looking to hire an
                        intern this summer. I’m doing this because R for the Rest of Us has a
                        lot of work and we could use some extra hands. And also because I’d like
                        to support someone early in their career who wants to improve their R
                        skills and learn about how a consulting business works.</p>
                    <p>If you’re selected to be the R for the Rest of Us summer intern,
                        you’ll work directly with me for the most part. I’m a pretty easygoing
                        guy and decent to work for, I think (I’ll be happy to connect you with
                        people who have worked for me who can confirm). You may also work
                        directly with <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/about/#consultants">R
                            for the Rest of Us consultants</a> on proejcts. I’ll do my best to make
                        sure you have a good experience and learn a lot.</p>
                    <p>I look forward to reading your application!</p>
                    <p>Cheers,</p>
                    <p>David</p>

                    <h2>Overview</h2>

                    <p>R for the Rest of Us is looking to hire a paid summer intern. This
                        fully-remote part-time position is a great opportunity for a student or
                        early-career professional looking to improve their R skills and learn
                        about running a business at the same time.</p>
                    <p>The internship will run for 10 weeks starting whenever the right
                        candidate is identified. Pay for this position is $30/hour with 10 hours
                        per week guaranteed (there is a possibility of more hours depending on
                        projects coming in and intern availability).</p>
                    <p>I particularly encourage applications from people of diverse
                        backgrounds throughout the world. There are no limitations on residence
                        for this position, though the intern will need to be able to have calls
                        with me during U.S. Pacific time work hours.</p>

                        <h2>About R for the Rest of Us</h2>
                        <p>R for the Rest of Us is run remotely by me along with <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/about/#consultants">several
                                consultants</a> in the United States and Europe. Our work is in two main
                            areas: education and consulting.</p>
                        <p>In education, R for the Rest of Us offers <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/online-courses">self-paced
                                courses</a>, a <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/3months/">three-month cohort-based
                                program</a>, and <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/custom-training/">custom trainings for
                                organizations</a>.</p>
                        <p>Consulting work (i.e.&nbsp;work where the R for the Rest of Us team does
                            the coding rather than teaching others how to do it) involves helping
                            organizations use R to improve their reporting and overall workflow.
                            Examples of such work include:</p>

                        <h2>What You'll Work On</h2>
                        <p>The summer intern will work on a combination of projects.</p>
                        <p>The main proejct will be working with David Keyes, R for the Rest of
                            Us CEO to develop an internal dashboard to track the company’s progress.
                            In addition, the intern will work on client projects, helping David with
                            video and podcast production for interviews he’s in the process of
                            conducting, general marketing work, and more.</p>
                        <p>I want this experience to be valuable to R for the Rest of Us
                            (obviously), but also to you. We have a number of projects and I’m happy
                            to work together to figure out which are the best fit for you to work
