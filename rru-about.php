        <p>I first used R in 2015 at a workshop at the American Evaluation Association conference. I was intrigued, but, since my co-workers at the time used Excel and SPSS, I let my newly learned skills lapse.</p>

        <p>In 2016, entering the world of consulting, I decided to give R another shot. I jumped back in, using free online resources to restart my R journey. I taught myself enough that I decided to give R a shot on a project I was working on.
          <span class="strong">I got a few steps in, hit a roadblock, and had to go back to Excel.</span></p>

      <div class="w-full px-5 my-5 overflow-hidden text-base text-blue-800 md:w-1/2">
        <p>A few weeks later, I tried R again on another project. Same result. I followed this pattern for several months, optimistically thinking I was ready to use R for a project, only to find my skills weren’t quite there yet.</p>

        <p>It’s a common story among those of us who teach ourselves R.

          Why R for the Rest of Us?
        </h2>

        <p>As I moved forward on my journey, I came to realize how powerful R is. I also realized how few non-hardcore quants use it .</p>

        <p>I started R for the Rest of Us to bring R to folks who do not yet use it. Folks who are good with data, but need a helping hand with this software. Folks who have used SPSS, SAS, Stata, or other data analysis software and have considered trying R, but haven’t know where to start. R for the Rest of Us is my attempt to demystify R so that others can embrace its power. </p>

        <p>I also want to make the community around R for the Rest of Us welcoming to all R learners. I’ve developed a <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a> that provides a set of behavior guidelines to ensure that this is possible. I invite you to <a href="https://rfortherestofus.com/code-of-conduct/">take a look at it</a> and let me know what you think. <br></p>

        <p>
          Think you know what an R user looks like? I'm probably not what you have in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm <span class="font-bold">not a hardcore quant</span> (my PhD is in anthropology). I'm not a coder ready to <strong>jump on you for any small mistake</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I want to help others <span class="font-bold">avoid the pain</span> that I went through learning R.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <span class="font-bold">teacher at heart</span> (shoutout to my former second grade students), I make R <strong>less scary</strong> and <strong>more fun</strong> (yes, fun).
